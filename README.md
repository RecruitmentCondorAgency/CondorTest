# MVC and C# - PRACTICAL

The practical test consists of a simple CRUD App writing with ASP.net 5.

Here you have a basic Login interface, with a CRUD for listing a set of Movies and series from different platforms. Your task will be to find and fix any bugs that prevent the app to function properly.

This app does not follow the best naming conventions, has some security issues and is missing functionality.

Apart from the Home, Login, and Register pages, no other page should be publicly accessible. You must make sure of this is happening.

Use any other modifications you consider applicable, folder structure, name of files, etc.

You will have 1 hour to make as many changes as you can.

## Will impact your evaluation.
