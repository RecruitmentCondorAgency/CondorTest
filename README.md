# MVC and C# - PRACTICAL

The practical test consists of a simple CRUD App written with ASP.net 5.

You will find a basic Login interface, with a CRUD for listing a set of movies and series from different platforms. Your task consistis in finding and fixing any bugs that prevent the app to function properly.

Keep in mind that his app does not follow the best naming conventions. It also has some security issues and is missing functionality.

Apart from the Home, Login, and Register pages, no other page should be publicly accessible. You must make sure that it remains this way.

Use any other modifications you consider applicable, folder structure, name of files, etc.

You will have 1 hour to make as many changes as you can.
